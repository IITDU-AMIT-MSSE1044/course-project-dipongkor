# On automatic testing of web search engines

Web search engines are very important because they are the means by which people retrieve information from the World Wide Web. However, testing these web search engines is difficult because there are no test oracles. Moreover, it is labor-intensive to judge the relevance of search results for a large number of queries, and these relevance judgments may not be reusable since the Web data change all the time. Web search engines are becoming more and more important for people to search for information in the World Wide Web. Given a query, a good search engine should return desired search results that possess various properties such as relevance, authority, and freshness. Providing inadequate search results could mislead or dissatisfy users. Thus, the motivation of this project is to implement a test oracle for web search engines. Following paper will be implement:-

### On automatic testing of web search engines [1]

Data collection is the main challenge here. Moreover, authors have proposed seven matrixes for evaluating search oracle. Thus, it is also a challenge to implement all these matrixes within this short period of time. 

I am not sure about the extension of this paper. I think it will take whole time to implement the existing matrixes. Anyway, if I get time after the existing paper implementation, then I will go for the extension by studying new approaches.
